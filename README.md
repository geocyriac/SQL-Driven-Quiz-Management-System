# SQL-Driven-Quiz-Management-System

A complete quiz platform developed entirely using SQL. This project simulates quiz registration, answering, scoring, and leaderboard generation using **stored procedures**, **triggers**, and **SQL tables**—all run through the command-line SQL interface, without any external application code.
